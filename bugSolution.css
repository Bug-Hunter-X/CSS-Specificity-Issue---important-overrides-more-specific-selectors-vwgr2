The most effective solution is to avoid using `!important` whenever possible.  In most cases, better CSS organization and structuring can resolve styling conflicts without resorting to `!important`.

Here's a possible solution using more specific selectors and removing the `!important` declaration:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

This solution relies on the proper order of CSS specificity.  The `.parent .child` selector is now the most specific and therefore overrides both `.parent` and `.child`.
